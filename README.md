Workbench is a work order tracking tool built to help small repair shops digitize work-orders so they can provide a modern customer experience to their customers.

Workflow:

Technician logs into the system and is presented with a dashboard,  listing in the Nav options to review: Open WorkOrders, Active WorkOrders, and Completed WorkOrders;

When a new customer walks in, their item description and contact info are added to the database;

Technician creates a work ticket with the repair description along with any notes;

Technician can lookup WorkOrders quick by searching for them with customers phone number in the searchbar available on the main dashboard ie:5558889999;

For everystep in the repair process, the technician logs hte status of the work order by updating it to (Open/Active/Completed), or deleting the word order all together;

Future features/itereations:
 
With every step in the repair process, the technician will be able to add notes to the work order, and the customer is to be notified via SMS, and provided with a link where they can view the work order on their phone or web.
